# 🏎️ F1 Strategy with GLMs and Decision Trees

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to the repo for my undergraduate thesis in Data Science — a deep dive into Formula 1 race strategies using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Decision Trees.  

📘 If you speak Spanish, you can check out the full thesis here: [Tesis.pdf](Tesis.pdf)  
Otherwise, stick around! This README will walk you through all the juicy details of the project.

If you're into statistics, data science, and Formula 1 (just like me 🏁), you're in for a treat!
